# grabInstg
This is a small app which grabs instagram pics/imgs for a given user account, and store them to designate local folder.
before running the app, please replace the name 'nike' to account name you'd like to grab:
line 42, userName = 'nike'

you can run this app by cmd line or PyCharm.

Run the same user account with the same output folder again, you can grab any updated pics. This app detects duplicate img file names, if exceed threshold, app will stop so you won't get files you already have.
